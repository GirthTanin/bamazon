# bamazon
A CLI named bamazon to demonstrate some working connections between JavaScript and MySQL files that can work to create a shopping experience from the console.

## Overview:
In this activity, I created an Amazon-like storefront with the MySQL skills I learned this week. The app will take in orders from customers and add up the cost from the customer.

## Instructions 
When opening the file customerBamazon.js in the terminal type npm start.  This will start the whole shopping experience.
